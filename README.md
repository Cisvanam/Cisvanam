Hi, I’m Chitvan! I’m a data geek based in Tempe, Arizona

while you are reading this I'm turning caffeine and chaos into clean datasets and clever insights.
I chase anomalies like they owe me money and treat SQL errors like plot twists.
If you love talking data, dashboards, or just want to rant about Excel — let’s connect!
